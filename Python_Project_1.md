# specsWeeks1

I have created a read books repository as my first python project. 
It store books to a .txt file, and can pull the information back and sort it in a variety of ways.
I have included a .txt file for seed information if so desired.

There is also a working three cup monty game included in the parent folder, but i cant take full credit for that, as it came from a code along.
